## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in UIverse, please report it responsibly.

### Contact

## What to Include

Please include the following details:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Possible impact (low, medium, high)
- Screenshots or code snippets, if applicable

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are fixed
- Allow maintainers reasonable time to respond and patch
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof of concept

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

Since UIverse is a frontend-focused project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), contributors should follow these best practices:

### Do

- Sanitize user inputs, if any dynamic input is added
- Use safe DOM manipulation methods
- Keep external libraries updated
- Write clean and readable code

### Avoid

- Using `eval()` or unsafe JavaScript execution
- Injecting raw HTML without validation
- Exposing sensitive data such as API keys or tokens
- Adding untrusted third-party scripts

## Dependencies & Assets

- Use trusted CDNs, for example Font Awesome
- Avoid outdated or vulnerable libraries
- Prefer lightweight and secure resources

## Scope of Security

This project mainly includes:

- Static UI components
- Client-side JavaScript
- No backend or database

Therefore, most risks are related to:

- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Unsafe DOM handling
- Malicious external scripts

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate contributors who responsibly report vulnerabilities and help improve the safety of UIverse 💙

## Updates

This security policy may evolve as the project grows and new features are added.
